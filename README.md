The goal of this project is to demonstrate how we can establish real-time connection between devices. This is the browser version of webRTC https://webrtc.org/ example build with reactJS. This UI will let you connect to my webRTC app https://github.com/zephyr-astra/webrtc_android_ios by exchanging generated offer/answer. You can send the offer/answer through any medium (email/messages) between devices. Once connected they will let you send and receive messages real time over the internet.
